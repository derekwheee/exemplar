# Exemplar

Exemplar is a lightly-opinionated framework for building static sites and rapid prototyping.

## Getting Started

Although Exemplar can be used with any build tools you want, it is reccommended that you use [`exemplar-cli`](https://github.com/frxnz/exemplar-cli).

```bash
npm install -g exemplar-cli
exemplar new my-new-site
cd my-new-site
```

Your Exemplar project has been set up, to view it run
```bash
exemplar serve
```

Your site is now available at <http://localhost:3000/>

For full documentation on the command line interface, see [`exemplar-cli`](https://github.com/frxnz/exemplar-cli).
